## 👨‍💻 About Me
🎓 2nd-year Software Engineering student based in the UK  
💻 I enjoy building things from the ground up: from **desktop apps → mobile → web**  
🔧 Strong foundation in **Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL (MySQL/Oracle)**  
☕ Coffee-driven, hands-on learner who enjoys solving problems by **tinkering, testing, and optimizing**  
🚗 Outside the laptop, my **Ford Kuga is my real-world testbed** for problem-solving, upgrading, tuning, and refining performance

## ⚡ Current Projects
📝 **Translator App** → built with a friend, starting on desktop and scaling to **Android/iOS**  
🧪 Side experiments with clean UI/UX design, API integrations, and small automation tools  
📂 Actively building a portfolio of projects to showcase practical software engineering skills

## 🌱 Learning Goals
📌 Full-stack frameworks (React, Node.js, Django)  
📌 Cloud basics (AWS / Azure) for deployment and scalability  
📌 Mobile development (Android/iOS) to broaden project reach  
📌 Writing more efficient, maintainable code — not just making it work, but making it **better**

## 🎯 Beyond Code
🏎️ **Cars** → applying engineering to the real world by tuning, upgrading, and optimizing performance  
☕ **Coffee** → the best debugging tool  
🛠️ **Tinkering** → I like to break things down, understand them, and rebuild better  
🌍 Always curious, always learning
