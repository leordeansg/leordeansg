# 🚀 Gabe | Software Engineering Student

> “Build it, break it, improve it.” – My approach to both code and cars.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
- 🎓 2nd-year Software Engineering student based in the UK  
- 💻 I enjoy building things from the ground up: from **desktop apps → mobile → web**  
- 🔧 Strong foundation in **Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL (MySQL/Oracle)**  
- ☕ Coffee-driven, hands-on learner who enjoys solving problems by **tinkering, testing, and optimizing**  
- 🚗 Outside the laptop, I’m deep into performance car tuning — the same **“optimize & push limits”** mindset applies to my coding projects

## ⚡ Current Projects
- 📝 **Translator App** – built with a friend, starting on desktop and scaling to **Android/iOS**  
- 🧪 Side experiments with clean UI/UX design, API integrations, and small automation tools  
- 📂 Actively building a portfolio of projects to showcase practical software engineering skills

## 🌱 Learning Goals
- Full-stack frameworks (React, Node.js, Django)  
- Cloud basics (AWS / Azure) for deployment and scalability  
- Mobile development (Android/iOS) to broaden project reach  
- Writing more efficient, maintainable code — not just making it work, but making it **better**

## 🎯 Beyond Code
- 🚗 **Cars** – my Ford Kuga is my testbed for problem-solving: upgrading, tuning, and refining performance  
- ☕ **Coffee** – best debugging tool  
- 🛠️ **Tinkering** – whether hardware or software, I like to break things down, understand them, and rebuild better  
- 🌍 Always curious, always learning
