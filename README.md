## 👨‍💻 About Me
Hey, I’m Gabe, a 2nd-year Software Engineering student in the UK.  
I like building real stuff that actually works, from desktop apps to mobile and web.  
Strong with **Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and SQL (MySQL & Oracle)**.  
I learn best by getting hands-on, breaking things, and making them better.  

---

## ⚡ What I’m Working On
📝 **Translator App** – building with a friend, starting as a desktop tool and expanding to **Android/iOS**.  
🧠 Small side projects around clean UI, API integrations, and automation tools.  
📁 Gradually building a portfolio that shows what I can *actually* do, not just what I’ve studied.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
📌 Full-stack frameworks → **React, Node.js, Django**  
📌 Cloud & deployment → **AWS / Azure**  
📌 Mobile dev → Android & iOS  
📌 Writing cleaner, more efficient code, not just “it works,” but “it works *well*.”
